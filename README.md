# Beauty-Salon-Home-Page

In this project I designed a home page for a beauty salon consisting of a navigation tab with 4 links and a body that consists of 2 sections, with the second section having 3 subsections. 

CSS pseudo classes, and the transform and transition CSS properties were used to make the webpage interactive.

Through this project I practiced my advanced skill in HTML and CSS.
